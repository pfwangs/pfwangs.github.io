              <p>Went to my first hackathon this weekend. To be honest was not really expecting to make anything. Low key wanted the free food, goodies, and drinks. I was about to just hangout with UnBoard and watch them work on The Resistance but I just had the urge to make something. I have no coding experience whatsoever besides CS10 (would not recommend) but Google is the greatest teacher alive.</p>

            <p>When to the CMYK Designathon this weekend. The event started a lot earlier than I would have liked and more than half the time was dediated to learning about the judges' backgrounds and our prompt. All of the judges were very legit with extremely stellar portfolios/work experience. I think their expertise in design made them better judges compared to those that were at the S.E.E. Designathon. There were 3 prompts but I cannot remember all of them. My group chose number 3 which was the design and market a new shampoo line for Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.</p>

        <p>Journaling</p>

            <p>I signed up for a couple classes that require me to engage in weekly journaling and creative writing for my last semester. Now that it is my last semester, I wanted to dedicate more time to the creative projects that I started earlier in college. I will probably write about some of the things going on in my life because I am doing that anyways, the places I eat at, the movies I watch, and maybe even the dreams that I have.</p>
